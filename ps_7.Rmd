#it is not equal to 0 (that is, not a 0 value created by our NA code above). If it is equal

#take districts not polled in the third wave and set the new column equal to the Democratic advantage
#in whichever wave it was actually polled in.

#That code worked for the non-NA values, but not the NA values I made equal to 0. Surprisingly,
#the following code finishes the job. By making a new Democratic advantage column (this one also
#called democratic_advantage), I make it the sum of waves 1 and 2 if the column I just created is equal
#to 0, and equal to the above column if it has a value. In other words, the final result is the
#Democratic advantage of the last polling of each district.
